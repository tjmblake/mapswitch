								   *mapswitch*

Note: This plugin was mostly created as a 'first plugin'.

This plugin allows you to easily set temporary keymaps for common processes.

It allows you to switch them on & off. See examples below:

							   *mapswitch.setup()*
mapswitch.setup({mappings})

    Load {mappings} into mapswitch. 
    This can be done repeatedly with different mappings.

    Mappings should be a key pair, with a mapping {name} and then
    a table of lists. Each list should be structured in {mode},{lhs},{rhs}
    similar to calling *vim.keymaps.set()
>

	mapswitch.setup({
	   dap = {
		{"n", "<Leader>h", function() print("hello") end},
		{"n", "<Leader>b", function() print("bye") end},
	   }
	})
<
    This loads the 'dap' into memory. You can then use *mapswitch.enable() and 
    *mapswitch.disable() to toggle these keymaps.

							  *mapswitch.enable()*
mapswitch.enable({name})

   Enable a mapswitch group by {name}. This overrides any current mappings.
>
	mapswitch.enable('dap')
<
							 *mapswitch.disable()*
mapswitch.disable({name})

    Disable an active mapswitch group by name. This restores any mappings
    which were previously overridden.
    >
	mapswitch.disable('dap')
< 
    TODO: Make it so you can disable more any mapswitch, not just the most
    recently added mapswitch.
